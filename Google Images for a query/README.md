# Google Images for a query

The main objective is to display the images as shown in Google Images, for a search query which will be entered by the user.

## Uses the following modules (the latest versions):
* requests
* IPython
* selenium (mainly for webdriver)
* bs4 (for BeautifulSoup)
* IPython.display (for Image and display)
* urllib.request (for Request and urlopen)
* google.colab.patches (for cv2_imshow)


## NOTE:
Run the code in [Scraping_Google_Images.py][1] only on **Google Colab**.
The code **won't** work on Jupyter Notebook.
